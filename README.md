# atari-lite
Some implementations of simplified Atari 2600 games.

The idea of this project is to create simplified versions of Atari 2600 games for testing reinforcement learning algorithms.
The full games from the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) are complicated and can make debugging algorithms difficult.
These simpler versions of the games may make it easier to design and test algorithms, before moving to more complicated domains.
